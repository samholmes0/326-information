# COMPSCI 326 Web Programming
# Syllabus

# Description

The World Wide Web was proposed originally as a collection of static
documents inter-connected by hyperlinks. Today, the web has grown into
a rich platform, built on a variety of protocols, standards, and
programming languages, that aims to replace many of the services
traditionally provided by a desktop operating system. Topics will
include: producing dynamic content using a server-based language,
content serving databases and XML documents, session state management,
multi-tier web-based architectures, web security, and core
technologies including HTTP, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL will be
emphasized. This course will also study concepts and technologies
including AJAX, social networking, mashups, JavaScript libraries
(e.g., jQuery), and web security. This course is hands-on and
project-based; students will construct a substantial dynamic web
application based on the concepts, technologies, and techniques
presented during lecture. This course satisfies the IE
Requirement. You must be a junior or senior to take this course. 3
credits.

# Textbooks and Material

This course does not require any books. Because of the ever changing
nature of the web we will instead rely upon currently material that is
freely available on the web including software documentation, blog
posts, tutorials, etc. Links to the reading will be providing on a
weekly basis.

# Course Objectives

* To learn the nature of the web.
* To understand the structure of the Internet and the Web.
* To study the general notion of protocols.
* To understand the TCP/IP protocol and understand its use in the web.
* To understand and apply the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
* To study and apply the HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
* To explore the Document Object Model (DOM).
* To understand and apply asynchronous and event-based programming style.
* To study and apply the basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
* To learn and apply CSS frameworks such as Twitter Bootstrap.
* To learn and understand the fundamentals of the JavaScript programming language.
* To learn the client/server model.
* To understand stateless versus stateful protocols.
* To understand connectionless versus connection-oriented protocols.
* To explore server-side JavaScript programming.
* To explore client-side JavaScript programming.
* To understand and apply the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
* To understand server-side routes.
* To understand and apply session state.
* To investigate and apply document-oriented databases.
* To learn and apply data interchange languages (JSON/XML).
* To understand and apply RESTful APIs.
* To understand Single Page Apps (SPA).

When you leave this course you should be fully capable of implementing
your own web application from scratch.

# Course Assessment

Student knowledge of the course material will be assessed by the
following categories:

* Semester Team Project (45%)
* Workshop Assignments (35%)
* Participation (20%)

The **semester team project** will begin early in the semester and
will be submitted in total at the end of the semester. At various
points during the semester your team will be required to submit
aspects of your project to be reviewed. These checkpoint team project
assignments will help guide you and your team towards a successful
project. Individual contributions to your team project will be
reviewed through commits to the version control system that your team
will be required to use. These assignments will be submitted through a
version control system that you will be required to use.

The **workshop assignments** will be reading/tutorial-based
assignments that will help you as an individual understand the
material being covered so you will be a capable contributor towards
your team project. These assignments will be submitted through a
version control system that you will be required to use.

**Participation** will be measured through the Readiness Assurance
Process (RAP) and possibly I-clicker based questions during class. The
RAP will follow a standard format (https://goo.gl/GoYElb) that helps
you prepare for a class. In addition, it will give you and your team
an opportunity to discuss questions and answers that will encourage
you to explore the material and prepare you for workshops. We will
drop two RAP and I-clicker scores at the end of the semester.

**There is no opportunity for extra credit** in this course. Unless
otherwise specified, so do not ask! The rough breakdown of percentages
and final grades for this course are A (93-100), A- (90-92), B+
(87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82), C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72), D+
(67-69), D (60-66), F (0-59). We do not scale grades.


# Course Policies and Other Requirements

The work for this course will consist of:

* Attending and actively participating in class meetings.
* Submitting any in class exercises or I-clicker questions/polls.
* Several team project assignments.
* Many workshop assignments.
* Final submission of the team project.
* Presenting the team project at the end of the semester.

# Course Structure

This course consists of approximately 24 class meetings. As this class
gathers in a team-based learning (TBL) classroom it will not follow
the standard lecture format. Rather, our time will be spent between
presenting material and working on so called “workshops”. Each
workshop is carefully designed to guide you through the material in
the course. In addition, you will be expected to participate in class
discussions and answer I-clicker polls and questions. You will be
required to do assigned reading in preparation of the workshop in
class and complete the workshop for submission outside of class. Much
of the assigned reading is the actual workshop itself and is vital for
your successful completion of the course. My primary role as the
instructor will be to meet with groups during the workshops to assess
your understanding of the workshop and to help guide you to successful
completion.

# Late Policy

Assignments that are submitted late will receive a 10% penalty for
each 24-hour period after the due date of an assignment up to 72 hours
(3 days). Assignments will not be accepted after the 72 hours. If
there are extreme circumstances (medical) that prevent you from
submitting an assignment on time a scanned note (e.g., doctor's note)
should be sent to the instructor of the course before or on the due
date of an assignment. Late assignments because of other activities
such as interviews, conferences, or other personal endeavors will not
be accepted. It is your responsibility to manage your own time.

# Communication

We will be using Piazza as the primary mode of communication in this
course. You should direct all your questions about the course and its
material to Piazza. The course staff will have assigned times during
the week, Monday to Friday, to respond to your posts. Do not expect
your posts to be answered over the weekend. Although we will try to
answer as many questions as possible, it will often be the case that
we can't answer all of them. You are encouraged to answer questions
posted by other students as well as posting useful information that
you think other students would benefit from. We will look at your
participation (number of instructor endorsed questions and answers) on
Piazza at the end of the semester to determine tie-breaking grades
(i.e., C- to a C, B+ to an A-).

Piazza provides support for "folders" for categorizing posts. There
will be several folders of interest to you. We will provide folders
that correspond to each workshop and startup assignment. In addition,
we will include each of the following folders that you should use to
post privately to instructors in the course:

* **grade_disputes** - used if you believe your grade on an assignment should be reviewed.
* **team_trouble** - used if there is an issue with a member(s) on your team.
* **medical** - used if you have a medical emergency and need to communicate to an instructor.
* **incomplete** – used if you are unable to complete the course during the scheduled semester.

If you post to any of these folders, please attach any relevant
documentation or assignment submission information so that the course
staff can provide an effective response to your request.

For all other requests or inquiries regarding the course not covered
by the above Piazza folders you should email the instructor at
richards@cs.umass.edu.

# Manners and Classroom Productivity

All students in this class are to be respected and discriminatory
behavior of any kind, both in class and online, will not be
tolerated. It is important to respect the instructor and their time in
preparing material for the course as well as their time in responding
to emails and Piazza posts. We expect everyone to participate in
class. This means you should come prepared to participate and be
actively engaged during the class meeting time. Please refrain from
the use of cellphones and laptops during the class time unless
explicitly told otherwise. If you are having trouble doing so it is
the responsibility of the instructor to ask you to leave to maintain a
productive learning environment.

# Attendance

You should attend every lecture. If you miss a class, talk to a friend
who was present, and check the course website for course announcements
and schedule. You are responsible for everything we tell you in class,
regardless of whether we post it to the course website. Your
participation in class is an important contribution to the success of
this course. You are responsible for asking questions, offering
comments, helping other students, and completing any in-class
exercises or I-clicker questions/polls.

# Team Policies

The largest component of this course is the semester team project. The
team formation will occur during the first couple of weeks of
class. You should discuss topics such as prior experience, course
background, goals for this course, workload, and schedule for the
semester. Your team will be required to find blocks of time during the
week to work on the team project to a successful completion. We expect
all team members to contribute their fair share and we expect to
assign the same grade to all members of the team. Members who
contribute less may receive a lower grade on the team assignment;
non-contributing members will receive a 0. In case of disputes the
teaching staff may interview team members on the project design and
implementation. We will also use the commit log in your team project
version control system repository to evaluate activity. All team
members will be required as part of the assessment of a team project
assignment to actively commit to the team repository.

Managing team dynamics and using each team member’s time and talents
effectively can be as difficult as solving the project. We are happy
to offer advice on how to handle these issues. Be open and candid with
your team about any potential problems early on so that your team can
plan around such problems and not fall behind. A sure way to make your
team upset at you is not finishing your part of the work at an
agreed-upon deadline and not informing them about the problems early
enough for them to help.

# Academic Honesty

It is very important in all courses that you are honest in all the
work that you complete. You can collaborate on your team project;
however, workshop assignments must be completed by you alone. If you
do not work alone on workshop assignments you are doing a disservice
to yourself, the instructors for the course, the College of
Information and Computer Sciences, the University of Massachusetts,
and your future. We design our courses to provide you the necessary
understanding and skill that will make you an excellent computer
scientist. Assignments are designed to test your knowledge and
understanding of the material. Plagiarism and academic honesty of any
sort may seem like an easy way to solve an immediate problem (which it
is not), however, it can have a substantial negative impact on your
career as a computer science student. There are many computing jobs
out there and many more people working hard to get those positions. If
you do not know your stuff you will have a very difficult time finding
a job. Please take this seriously.

We will carefully review your submissions automatically and manually
to verify that “cheating” has not taken place. If you are suspected of
plagiarism, we will follow an informal path to determine if academic
dishonesty has taken place. If you are found guilty you will receive
an F for the course and it will go on your permanent record at
UMass. This will disrupt your schedule for completing courses and may
lead to you not completing your degree in a timely fashion. You should
carefully review the Academic Honesty Policy, Avoiding Plagiarism, and
the Academic Honesty Flowchart to understand what academic honesty is,
how you can avoid it, and the procedure we will follow if you are
under suspicion.

Every assignment implicitly includes a “contract” that you sign
virtually by submitting your assignment. By “signing” this contract
you indicate that you have read all the documents on this website and
any links to academic honesty associated with the university. Your
signature indicates that you completely understand the policies in
place and that you have not plagiarized.

# Incompletes

An incomplete in this course will only be granted during the third to
last week of the course (4/10/2017 – 4/14/2017) with a maximum of two
assignments not completed. Incomplete requests will not be accepted
before or after that time period. If you fail to contact the
instructor during that time your request will not be granted. The
incomplete period will be announced in class during this time.

# Schedule

Below is the starting schedule for the course. There may be
circumstances when the schedule must be changes or updated to ensure
the best delivery of the material in this course. You will be
responsible for referring to this schedule throughout the semester,
updating your own calendar of important events and assignments, and
referring to Moodle to ensure that you have the most up-to-date
information and schedule. It is ultimately your responsibility to keep
up with the course to guarantee your success.
